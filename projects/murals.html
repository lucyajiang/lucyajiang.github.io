                <p>Though public art is intended to be accessible to all, it is largely inaccessible to blind and low vision (BLV) people in the absence of visual descriptions. Some organizations have begun tackling this issue; for example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vocaleye.ca/">VocalEye</a> is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing greater access to theater, arts, and cultural events for BLV people of all ages. Starting in the summer of 2022, VocalEye organized multiple crowdsourcing initiatives, dubbed "Crowders," to encourage the public to submit descriptions of murals for Vancouver's Mural Festival. Inspired by my participation in their prior Crowders, in November 2022, I initiated a project to extend VocalEye's mural accessibility crowdsourcing efforts, previously only conducted in Canada. In collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ithacamurals.com/">Ithaca Murals</a>, a non-profit art and activism organization, we engaged both BLV and sighted people in this crowdsourced urban accessibility effort.</p>
                <p>I am incredibly grateful to have worked with VocalEye and Ithaca Murals to bring the first-ever Satellite Crowder to life! From receiving 100+ descriptions, to hosting in-person tours, this entire project was a beautiful celebration of Ithaca's art, artists, and advocacy.</p>
